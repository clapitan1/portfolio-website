# portfolio-website

For my HTML portfolio, I started off with the image of putting my contact info right beside all of the content of the project. I wanted to have pictures of my projects in a slideshow format but unfortunately I was unable to execute the coding for that. The next best format I thought of was to just stack the about me section above the projects and then have the contact me section under everything else.

For my CSS, I made the background the color of a manila folder.
